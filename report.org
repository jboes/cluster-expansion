* CuPd bcc -> fcc transition
The bcc transforms to fcc through the body centered tetragonal (bct) shape as shown in Figure ref:fig-bct.

As dimension 'c/a' becomes equal to 1, the bct structure becomes bcc (i.e. 'c'='a'). Similarly, when 'c' becomes equal to the square root of 2, the structure becomes fcc. This is demonstrated graphically in Figure ref:fig-fcctobcc.

* Energies of the diffusion pathway
Figure ref:fig-3D shows a 3-dimensional image of the minimum energy pathway. There is approximately 50meV difference between the two structures. The pathways does not follow a simple path of constant 'a' or 'c'.

Note: lines of constant 'c/a' are representative of equations of state i.e. only volume changes, while the relative magnitudes of the vectors are constant.

The minimum energy pathway is shown via 'c/a' in Figure ref:fig-2D. Interestingly, there is no appreciable barrier to speak of.

* New ground state hull (isif=7)
The ground state hull of fcc and bcc CuPd needed to be recalculated due to relaxation of the atoms out of phase. Figure ref:fig-gshull shows the results of the cluster expansion ground state hull with isif=7.

Visual inspection on the structures appears to show that "elongated" bulk configurations are likely to be candidates for poor prediction.

However, a more systematic approach is needed for identifying these poorly fitted regions.

One possible method of identifying dissimilar structures would be to use structure analysis tools. cite:hundt-2006-cmpz
