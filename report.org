* CuPd bcc -> fcc transition
The bcc transforms to fcc through the body centered tetragonal (bct) shape as shown in Figure ref:fig-bct.

As dimension 'c/a' becomes equal to 1, the bct structure becomes bcc (i.e. 'c'='a'). Similarly, when 'c' becomes equal to the square root of 2, the structure becomes fcc. This is demonstrated graphically in Figure ref:fig-fcctobcc.

* Energies of the diffusion pathway
Figure ref:fig-3D shows a 3-dimensional image of the minimum energy pathway. There is approximately 50meV difference between the two structures. The pathways does not follow a simple path of constant 'a' or 'c'.

Note: lines of constant 'c/a' are representative of equations of state i.e. only volume changes, while the relative magnitudes of the vectors are constant.

The minimum energy pathway is shown via 'c/a' in Figure ref:fig-2D. Interestingly, there is no appreciable barrier to speak of.

* New ground state hull (isif=7)
The ground state hull of fcc and bcc CuPd needed to be recalculated due to relaxation of the atoms out of phase. Figure ref:fig-gshull shows the results of the cluster expansion ground state hull with isif=7.

Visual inspection on the structures appears to show that "elongated" bulk configurations are likely to be candidates for poor prediction.

However, a more systematic approach is needed for identifying these poorly fitted regions.

One possible method of identifying dissimilar structures would be to use structure analysis tools. cite:hundt-2006-cmpz

For some reason, the EOS for the worst fits are very distorted, although nothing appears wrong with the geometries.

There are some minor inconsistencies in certain fcc configurations as well.

The bcc structures have been removed from the database.

** Testing of multiple NNs

*** Fit to data included in NN
Initial NNs were trained with several structure types:

hiddenlayers: 2, 3, and 4
nodes: 30, 40, and 50

All residuals fit well to the data points included in the fitting process, as expected.
