* CuPd bcc -> fcc transition					   :noexport:
The bcc transforms to fcc through the body centered tetragonal (bct) shape as shown in Figure ref:fig-bct.

As dimension 'c/a' becomes equal to 1, the bct structure becomes bcc (i.e. 'c'='a'). Similarly, when 'c' becomes equal to the square root of 2, the structure becomes fcc. This is demonstrated graphically in Figure ref:fig-fcctobcc.

* Energies of the diffusion pathway				   :noexport:
Figure ref:fig-3D shows a 3-dimensional image of the minimum energy pathway. There is approximately 50meV difference between the two structures. The pathways does not follow a simple path of constant 'a' or 'c'.

Note: lines of constant 'c/a' are representative of equations of state i.e. only volume changes, while the relative magnitudes of the vectors are constant.

The minimum energy pathway is shown via 'c/a' in Figure ref:fig-2D. Interestingly, there is no appreciable barrier to speak of.

* New ground state hull (isif=7)				   :noexport:
The ground state hull of fcc and bcc CuPd needed to be recalculated due to relaxation of the atoms out of phase. Figure ref:fig-gshull shows the results of the cluster expansion ground state hull with isif=7.

* Neural work
A summary of the work performed on CuPd neural networking July 20-24th.

** EOS of ground state configurations
A previous neural network performed revealed poor fits to ground state data produced from cluster expansions:

Visual inspection on the structures appears to show that "elongated" bulk configurations are likely to be candidates for poor prediction.

However, a more systematic approach is needed for identifying these poorly fitted regions.

One possible method of identifying dissimilar structures would be to use structure analysis tools. cite:hundt-2006-cmpz

*** EOS of problematic structures

Further inspection revealed that the structures with the worst fits have very disordered EOS

although nothing appears wrong with the geometries.

There are some minor inconsistencies in certain fcc configurations as well.

The bcc structures shown above have been removed from all database moving forward. 

I am not sure how to fix these calculations, or that it is worth the effort.

** Testing of multiple NNs

*** Fit to data included in NN
Initial NNs were trained with several structure types:

hiddenlayers: 2, 3, and 4
nodes: 30, 40, and 50

#+caption: Neural network fit to fcc to bcc transition pathway (included in fitting data)
#+attr_latex: :width 4in

#+caption: Residuals to above pathway data
#+attr_latex: :width 4in
#+attr_org: :width 400
[[./images/multinn-path2.png]]

All residuals fit well to the data points included in the fitting process.

This suggests that it should be possible to produce highly accurate fits, even for alloys.

*** Fit to data NOT included in NN

#+caption: Residuals to all EOS in the database
#+attr_latex: :width 4in

The data at the end represents the bct structures included in the fitting and are magnified in Figure ref:fig-res-bct.

#+caption: Residuals to bct data included in the fit
#+attr_latex: :width 4in

Again, very good (and rapid fitting) to all points of the PES for transition from fcc to bcc through bct configurations.

The mutliNN shows that surface predictions are not yet possible with the current model.
